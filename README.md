# GET_NEXT_LINE
I dont have to say a lot about this proyect only that if you do this one after doing ft_printf (bonus), you will find it pretty simple. The only challenging thing i could saw, it was coding the function that saves the rest of the buffer in a static string. The rest very easy.

Peace, :v:
